            If you are on Drupal 9, use <a href="#">Upgrade Status on your Drupal 9</a> site to get an estimate of the work needed. The plan provided
            by the module will tell you where to use <a href="#">drupal-rector</a> to update your own custom code and where to help contributed
            projects update their code.

            <a href="#">more than 2,500 projects ready for D10 even before its release</a>, there's a good chance everything you need is ready.

            <a href="#">Drupal 7 will be end of life in January 2025</a>. Yes, this is after the planned release of Drupal 10. While Drupal 10 will
            include migration tools from Drupal 7, it is much more likely that the contributed projects you use are available for Drupal 9 already.
            Don't wait! Start updating to Drupal 9 soon. The move to Drupal 10 will be way easier from Drupal 9.
